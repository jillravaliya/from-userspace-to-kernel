⁠A documented exploration of Linux kernel engineering. This repository contains working kernel modules, device drivers, and technical documentation explaining low-level systems programming from first principles.

---

## What This Repository Is

> A technical record of Linux kernel development work. 

*Contents:*

- ⁠Kernel modules that compile, load, and execute in kernel space
- ⁠Documentation explaining operating system internals and hardware interaction
- ⁠Implementations of memory management, device drivers, and synchronization
- ⁠Build instructions, verification logs, and debugging notes

Each implementation includes source code, technical explanation, and proof of execution.

---

## Work Pattern

> This repository follows a daily implementation model.

Each directory represents one focused session: a specific kernel concept implemented, a particular module built, or a technical problem solved. Numbered sequentially. Self-contained. Each includes source code, technical documentation, and execution verification.

Not a course. Not tutorials. Just consistent work building kernel-level code.

---

## Why This Path

Started in DevOps—containers, orchestration, infrastructure automation. The tools worked. The concepts made sense. But something was missing.

> **The shift:** Realized the interest wasn't in automating abstractions, but in understanding what's beneath them.

Kernel development is working at the layer where:
- Hardware meets software
- Memory becomes addresses, not variable names
- Security is enforced by CPU rings, not configuration files
- Every instruction has consequences

This isn't rejection of previous work. It's recognition of where technical curiosity actually leads—toward understanding how systems work at the foundational level, not just how to use them.

**Core drive:** Build things that demand understanding how computers actually function.
